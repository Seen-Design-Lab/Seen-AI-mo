Project Overview
----------------

The SeenAI project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict user engagement with online content. The model will be trained on a dataset of user surveys, interviews, and interaction logs.

Architecture
------------

The project is structured into the following modules:

1.  Preprocessing:
    -   Handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation.
    -   Responsible for preparing the raw data for model training.
2.  Model:
    -   Defines the machine learning model architecture.
    -   Includes the model training and evaluation logic.
3.  Training:
    -   Coordinates the training process, including hyperparameter tuning.
    -   Saves the trained model for later use.
4.  Evaluation:
    -   Evaluates the model's performance on a held-out test set.
    -   Generates metrics and visualizations to assess the model's effectiveness.

### Preprocessing

The preprocessing module is responsible for cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for model training. This includes:

-   Handling missing values
-   Encoding categorical features
-   Scaling numerical features
-   Generating new features from the raw data

The preprocessing steps are implemented in the `preprocessing.py` file, which provides functions for each of the data transformation tasks.

### Model

The model module defines the architecture of the machine learning model. It includes the following components:

-   Model definition: The model architecture is specified using a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
-   Training: The model training logic, including the loss function, optimizer, and training loop.
-   Evaluation: Functions for evaluating the model's performance on a test set, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The model-related code is implemented in the `model.py` file.

### Training

The training module coordinates the overall model training process. It includes the following responsibilities:

-   Hyperparameter tuning: Implementing a grid search or random search to find the optimal hyperparameter values for the model.
-   Model checkpointing: Saving the trained model at regular intervals to enable resuming the training process.
-   Logging and monitoring: Tracking the training progress and logging relevant metrics for later analysis.

The training logic is implemented in the `train.py` file.

### Evaluation

The evaluation module is responsible for assessing the performance of the trained model. It includes the following tasks:

-   Evaluating the model on a held-out test set
-   Generating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
-   Visualizing the model's performance, such as confusion matrices or ROC curves

The evaluation code is implemented in the `evaluate.py` file.

Chosen Algorithms and Models
----------------------------

For the SeenAI project, we have chosen to use a deep learning-based approach, specifically a neural network model. The rationale for this choice is that neural networks have shown excellent performance in a wide range of machine learning tasks, including predicting user engagement with online content.

The specific model architecture and hyperparameters will be determined during the model development and training phases, as we explore different model configurations and evaluate their performance on the dataset.
